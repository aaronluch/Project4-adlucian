# CS 2240 Project 4

For this project, you will sort the 1000 objects from your data set. You will modify each sorting algorithm to collect data. You will analyze the results from the different sorting algorithms. You will test the stability of each algorithm.

## Implement
You should have your 1000+ objects stored in a vector, initially unsorted. Your custom class should overload all comparison operators, and you can compare them based on any field you like (it doesn't have to be a unique field).

Use these sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
1. At least one more stable sorting algorithm
1. Heap Sort
1. At least one more unstable sorting algorithm

Modify each sorting algorithm to record the number of **reads**. This is the number of times you use a Comparable object. This could be using it to store somewhere else, using it to compare to another object, etc. Temporary Comparable objects count towards the reads. 
* Example code:
  ```cpp
  if (vec[i] > vec[i+1]) // This counts as two reads, which should
      // be counted whether the if statements evaluates to true or false.
  Comparable temp = vec[i]; // This is one read.
  smaller.push_back(vec[i]); // This is one read.
  ```
Modify each sorting algorithm to record the number of **writes**. This is the number of times you assign into a Comparable object. This could be to store a temporary Comparable, to overwrite an item in a Comparable vector, to push_back onto a Comparable vector, etc.
* Example code:
  ```cpp
  Comparable temp = vec[i]; // This is one write (and one read).
  smaller.push_back(vec[i]); // This is one write (and one read).
  vec[i] = vec[i+1]; // This is one write (and one read).
  ```
Use a loop to record the number of reads and writes needed to sort a vector of size 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000.
* Hint: start with 1000 and then use the resize method to make it smaller. 

Each of the sorting algorithms should be given identical unsorted vectors to begin with. 
* Note that the starter code passes the vector to each sorting algorithm by value (not by reference). This means that calling one of the sorting algorithms from the main function will *not* modify the vector in main that you pass to the function.
* If your data is naturally sorted by the attribute you use to overload your operators, change how you overload your operators.

Finally, the starter code includes a function in main.cpp called `stabilityTest` and is set up for bubble sort and heap sort. Add your other two sorting functions to `stabilityTest` and observe the output critically. You will be asked to analyze the output in your report.
* Note that this part of the starter code may require modification if you're passing read and write variables into the sorting functions.

## Extra Credit
To earn up to 10 extra credit points (at the grader’s discretion), you can get more thorough results. This can include, but is not limited to:
* Setting timers to record how long it takes you to sort the objects with each algorithm.
* Performing the same experiment, except double the size of the data set each time (instead of having it grow linearly).
* Using more than four sorting algorithms. This includes storing and graphing the read and write counts, adding the algorithm(s) to the `stabilityTest` function, and including the algorithm(s) in the answers to the questions in the report.

Note that if you add this logic to your code but do not analyze it in your report, it will not count towards extra credit. If you complete extra credit, clearly label it in your README.md report.

## Report
Include the following in this section of your README.md file:
* Information about your data set (you will be assigned a different grader for this project).
* Analyze the data. Graph the number of reads and writes for each sorting algorithm and look at how the number of reads and writes grows when the size of the data set grows. Compare and contrast the different sorting algorithms and draw conclusions about which sorting algorithms are more efficient. Discuss complexities and their effects.
* Look at the output from the stabilityTest function and answer the following questions:
  * How are the names sorted by default?
  * How is the output from the two stable sorting algorithms different from the two unstable ones? Be specific in your answer, and use what you know about how each sorting algorithm works to justify your observations.
* Answers to the following questions: 
  * If you need to sort a contacts list on a mobile app, which sorting algorithm(s) would you use and why? 
  * What about if you need to sort a database of 20 million client files that are stored in a datacenter in the cloud?

**Note: Any code that was not authored by yourself or the instructor must be cited in your report. This includes the use of concepts not taught in lecture.**

## Submit
You must include your source (all .cpp and .h) files, your data (.csv) file(s), CMakeLists.txt, and your updated README.md file that contains your report to your repository. Submit to Gradescope using the GitHub repository link, double-check that all the correct files are there, and wait for the autograder to provide feedback.

## Grading
